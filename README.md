"The next season of "Mandalorec" will be very interesting, because you will start to learn about the power of a child, what really means a child," says Esposito. - You'll also start to learn about the origin of the dark sword that Moff Gideon has, and how it relates to the past of Star Wars, Clone Wars and other projects.

"And you will start to understand the scale of 'Star Wars'," continues the actor. - We live in a huge universe, in which so much has not yet been explored. So, I think the series will begin to lay the foundation for the scale, which will appear in seasons three and four, when you really start to get answers".
